The Assingment is divided into 2 sets - Tasks and Features.
Candidates are free to implement any single or multiple task.
Features are optional and hence are not mandatory, but implementing it would increaes their weighted in interview.

Candidates must not use any 3rd party library. Assingment will not be evaluated if 3rd party library is used


1. Go to https://exchangeratesapi.io/
This website will provide you data regarding the exchange rate for various curriencies.
You have to use the REST End point exposed by https://exchangeratesapi.io/ to get the required data for the assingment.
Your task is to
  - [T-1] Plot the graph of INR  exchange rate against USD from 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Jan 2019.
  - [T-2] Plot the graph of INR and GBP exchange rate against USD from 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Jan 2019.
  - [T-3] Plot the graph of INR and GBP exchange rate against USD from 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Jan 2019 and also indicate current rate for INR and GBP on graph itself.

  Nice to have feature
  - [F-1] - Make date range dyanamic so that we can select our own date range
  - [F-2] - Make selection of currency symbol dyanamic, so we can choose any currency and graph should update accordingly.


  - You can chosse any graph style as per your choice but it should represent data in meaningfull way.

  1. You must fork this empty git repository.
     - Github link : https://github.com/winsoft-technologies/2020-interns
  2. Once you forked it they you clone their own copy on your machines and can start coding.
  3. You have to do periodic commits, so that we can track the code development process.
  4. Once you are done, you have to generate the pull request into the main github repo from where you have cloned. (https://github.com/winsoft-technologies/2020-interns)
  5. While generating pull request make sure your title discribe what you have done....
     For Example:
        A candidate who have implemet only task 1 should have title
        [T - 1] - <some short discription>
       
        A candidate who have implemet only task 1 and 2 should have title
        [T - 1 - 2] - <some short discription>

        A candidate who have implemet only task 1 and Feature 1 should have title
        [T - 1 - F - 1] - <some short discription>

        A candidate who have implemet only task 1,2 and Feature 1,2 should have title
        [T - 1 - 2 - F - 1-2] - <some short discription>
  6. Only first "n" pull requested will be evaluated.
  7. If any copy is found then both candidates will be disqulified.
  8. Candidate attempting more task and feature will obiviously take more time than the one implemting single task,
     hence top "n" will be shortlistied accordingly, so dont be in hurry if you fell confident try implementing more Task and Feature to make your candidature more solid.
